This project was undertaken as part of the [2018 MIND Summer School](https://summer-mind.github.io) hackathon sessions.

This repository contains a set of exploratory analyses of text annotations of the [Sherlock data](https://github.com/Summer-MIND/mind_2018/tree/master/tutorials/sherlock_nifti_kit_v2_withdata) from [Chen et al. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4450), using the [**embeddingtools**](https://github.com/damiencrone/embeddingtools) package for **R**. Specifically, these analyses entail (1) constructing vector representations of the semantic content of scence segments, (2) constructing vector representations of broad psychological concepts (e.g., taken from recently developed situational taxonomies), and then (3) measuring the semantic similarity of each scene segment to each psychological concept over the course of the entire scan.
